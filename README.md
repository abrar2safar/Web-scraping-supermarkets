  By : Abrar Safar
  
  
  
## Intro 

scraped data from multiple websites, scraped it each as seperate category as its in basket .. 
***I used beautiful soup and seleinium drive , code is in jupyter notebook attached***


## Problem Statment : 

finding out whether or not scraped data is a reasonable suorce for CPI




## Datasets describtion : 

|Feature|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|item|object|name of the product| 
|price|float64|price of the product| 
|amount|int|number of a material| 


## Conclusions and Recommendations :

* Data from internet are absolutely applicable for CPI 
* Some supermarkets don't offer purchasing thier products its only for offers and seasons 
* Prices might be affected by ramadan season
